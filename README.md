# BlackJack beta 0.3
Third release of the gamble game.

We added a main menu, with a choice of "SinglePlayer" (it's a beta of the A.I.), "Multiplayer" (with a maximum amount of 5 players), and a "Rules" section to write on... But it's empty for now ;-)

There's just a little issue with the multiplayer, and that's if a player goes over 21, the entire game stops, making the others players winners.
The code has a structure similar to the first version of the game, every step is declared and it takes space to the memory and time to compile.
The file has almost the same size as the first release, but on the most recent there are more features than the first, of course...
And, naturally, on the next releases the code will be reduced, making it more lightweight.
And why not, we could add more features...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BlackJack beta 0.2
And now, the second release.

As we said in the previous release, the code is really really reduced, from 633 stripes of code to 130 stripes, reducing also more than 80% of the file wight (from 13.2 kb to 2.54). 
Did it lose any functionality? Absolutly not!
It's not very comfortable to play yet, and it didn't get any new additions, but we're just in the beta versions...

# BlackJack beta 0.1
We are happy to announce BlackJack!
This is the first release of the famous gamble game, but here there are no money to win, just fun.
The game works, but it's not very comfortable.
To play, you need two player, player one and player two and, as you run the script, the game immediatly starts.
That's why, in the next release (probably a beta yet), a main menu will be added.

There are some modified rules, for example the ace has "1" as the only value, while, in the original game, you can choose "1" or "11"; there are five rounds, so, after the fifth round, there will be a check to say "And the winner is...".

The code is actually really long, and in the next releases it will be reduced, but it won't lose its functionalities.
