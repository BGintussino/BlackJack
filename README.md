# BlackJack beta 0.1
We are happy to announce BlackJack!
This is the first release of the famous gamble game, but here there are no money to win, just fun.
The game works, but it's not very comfortable.
To play, you need two player, player one and player two and, as you run the script, the game immediatly starts.
That's why, in the next release (probably a beta yet), a main menu will be added.

There are some modified rules, for example the ace has "1" as the only value, while, in the original game, you can choose "1" or "11"; there are five rounds, so, after the fifth round, there will be a check to say "And the winner is...".

The code is actually really long, and in the next releases it will be reduced, but it won't lose its functionalities.
